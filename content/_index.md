Anglican worship is designed to saturate people in the truth and implications of the good news of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection. Our sincere hope is to make disciples of Jesus who’s lives flow out of a deep, heart-felt conviction of Jesus’ sacrificial love and sovereign lordship, walking in the fruits and renewal of the Holy Spirit, to the glory and pleasure of God the Father."
