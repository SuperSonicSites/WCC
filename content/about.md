whoweare: "<h3>We founded Westcoast Connect to help get packages out to the Coast.</h3>
<p>We grew the business through word of mouth and soon we had a thriving operation helping deliver packages to all our friends in Ucluelet & Tofino</p>
<p>At our core weâ€™ve grown along side our customers, and are so happy to be part of fabric of our West Coast communities. We go out of our way to help get everything delivered on time, do it with a smile and above all we are friendly.</p><p>Thanks so much for all your business and support!</p>
